<h2>New evidence released Dec. 8</h2>
<p>On December 8, 2014, the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office made public additional evidence that was presented to the grand jury that ultimately decided not to charge former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson with a crime for the shooting death of Michael Brown on August 9, 2014.</p> 
<p>The evidence consists of eight statements made to federal investigators, radio traffic from the day of the shooting, the autopsy performed by the federal medical examiner, audio of the shooting captured by a user of the video chat service Glide, and the transcript of prosecutor Bob McCulloch’s speech from November 24, 2014, announcing the grand jury’s decision not to charge Wilson.</p>
<p> 
A spokesman for prosecutor Bob McCulloch told KSDK-TV that the evidence had been held back at the request of the federal government, which is conducting its own investigation into Brown’s death. It’s not immediately clear whether this is all the evidence the grand jury heard over 25 days.</p>
